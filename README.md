## 🛡️ About This Repo
This is my central spot for tracking everything I learn in web security. It’s a collection of my write-ups, payloads, and notes from various labs like **PortSwigger Academy**, **Lord of SQLi**, and **TheXSSRat**. 

My goal is to document how I found each bug and the exact steps I took to exploit it.

## 🛠️ My Process
- **Analysis**: Breaking down how the web app works and finding where it's weak.
- **Evidence**: Taking screenshots and notes of every successful exploit.
- **Payloads**: Building and testing custom scripts to bypass security filters.
